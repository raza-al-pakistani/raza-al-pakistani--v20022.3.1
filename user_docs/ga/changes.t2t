=== New Laptop Keyboard Layout ===
The laptop keyboard layout has been completely redesigned in order to make it more intuitive and consistent.
The new layout uses the arrow keys in combination with the NVDA key and other modifiers for review commands.

Please note the following changes to commonly used commands:
|| Name | Key |
| Say all | NVDA+a |
| Read current line | NVDA+l |
| Read current text selection | NVDA+shift+s |
| Report status bar | NVDA+shift+end |
In addition, among other changes, all of the object navigation, text review, mouse click and synth settings ring commands have changed.
Please see the [Commands Quick Reference keyCommands.html] document for the new keys.
